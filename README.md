## Introduction
Java remains a versatile, powerful, and in-demand programming language. With constant updates and robust community support, Java continues to power enterprise-grade applications, microservices, and cloud-native solutions.

This repository provides:
- A well-defined roadmap for learning Java in 2025.
- Practical projects for hands-on learning.
- Resources to understand new Java paradigms and tools.

## Why Java in 2025? üî•
Java continues to be the backbone of scalable systems. Here's why learning Java in 2025 is critical:
- **Modern Features:** With the latest Java LTS releases (Java 21+), enhanced performance, and productivity features like Records, Virtual Threads, and Pattern Matching.
- **Cloud-Native Applications:** Java frameworks like Spring Boot dominate cloud-native development.
- **Microservices & APIs:** Ideal for building RESTful APIs and Microservices.
- **Community & Ecosystem:** Supported by vast libraries, tools, and frameworks.

## Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

### Phase 1: Core Java Fundamentals
- Learn the basics: **Variables, Data Types, Control Flow, and Functions**.
- Master Object-Oriented Programming: **Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**.
- Explore modern Java features:
  - **Lambda Expressions**
  - **Stream API**
  - **Pattern Matching**
  - **Records**
  - **Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**

### Phase 2: Advanced Java
- Concurrency and Multithreading:
  - Virtual Threads (Project Loom).
  - CompletableFuture and ForkJoinPool.
- Collections Framework: Deep dive into Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues.
- Exception Handling and Custom Exceptions.

### Phase 3: Spring Boot and Microservices
- **Spring Boot 3.x**: Learn to build robust APIs.
- Explore microservices architecture: Service discovery, API Gateway.
- **Spring Cloud**: Circuit Breaker, Config Server, and Service Registry.

### Phase 4: Persistence & Databases
- Learn modern database interactions with **JPA** and **Spring Data**.
- Explore NoSQL with **MongoDB**.
- Advanced querying with **JPQL** and **Criteria API**.

### Phase 5: DevOps & Cloud-Native Java
- Dockerize your Java apps.
- Use Kubernetes to manage containers.
- Deploy on **AWS** or **GCP**.
- Monitor with Prometheus and Grafana.

### Phase 6: System Design and Best Practices
- Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory, and Builder.
- Architecture: Monolith vs. Microservices.
- Performance optimization and scalability.
